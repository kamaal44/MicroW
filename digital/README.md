# MicroW - Digital components

## Overview

Every module (receiver and emitter) is equipped with a microcontroller that basically acts as a serial/analog converter (we use [STM32F429ZI](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f429zi.html) microcontrollers). Radio transmission and encryption is performed by [Digi XbeeÂ® S1 802.15.4 RF Modules](https://www.digi.com/pdf/ds_xbeemultipointmodules.pdf). Those Xbee modules act as a serial line that can reach 250kb/s.

We use a sampling rate of 16kHz (most modern VoIP and VVoIP communication products sample at this frequency). The sampling rate is controlled by timers connected to ADC and DAC.  With a bit depth of 12 bits per sample, we only need a 192kb/s UART interface if we send samples without any data compression.
