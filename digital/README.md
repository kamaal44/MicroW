# MicroW - Digital components

## Overview

Every module (receiver and emitter) is equipped with a microcontroller that basically acts as a serial/analog converter (we use [STM32F429ZI](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f429zi.html) microcontrollers). Radio transmission and encryption is performed by [Digi XbeeÂ® S1 802.15.4 RF Modules](https://www.digi.com/pdf/ds_xbeemultipointmodules.pdf). Those Xbee modules act as a serial line that can reach 250kb/s.

We use a sampling rate of 16kHz (most modern VoIP and VVoIP communication products sample at this frequency). A timer controlls the sampling rate of the ADC (and the refresh rate of the DAC). With a bit depth of 12 bits per sample, we only need a 192kb/s UART interface if we send samples without any data compression. We actually configured the UART interface at 230400 baud because it's the first standard value greater than 192000 baud.

Source codes of the microcontrollers and corresponding documentation are in [STM32F429ZI Source codes](https://github.com/sonibla/MicroW/tree/master/digital/STM32F429ZI%20Source%20codes) folder.
